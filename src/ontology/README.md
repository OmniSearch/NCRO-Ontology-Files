This is release of 2015-12-10, about when the first paper is
published. There is still a long to-do list. In particular the
representation of gene families will be changed in the next release.

As this ontology is currently undergoing major changes. ID deprecation
policies will start in the next couple of months. In the mean time,
identifiers may be deleted and not marked obsolete. You could consider
this an alpha version.
